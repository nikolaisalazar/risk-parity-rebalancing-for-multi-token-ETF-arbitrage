# Risk-Parity Rebalancing for Multi-Token ETFs
A back-tested blockchain trading strategy for ECE 473: Elements of Decentralized Finance

# Background
Strategy investigates statistical arbitrage opportunities in multi-token cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) through pairs trading with synthetic portfolios. Using historical price data for multi-token ETFs like Bitwise's BITW, we implemented a trading strategy that pairs these ETFs with synthetic portfolios and identifies arbitrage opportunities based on pricing discrepancies. We ran Monte Carlo simulations to backtest and measure market capitalization (market cap) and risk-parity balancing strategies using metrics such as cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and volatility.
