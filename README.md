# Risk-Parity Rebalancing for Multi-Token ETFs
A back-tested blockchain trading strategy for ECE 473: Elements of Decentralized Finance

# Background
With the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies and digital assets in decentralized finance (DeFi) by traditional finance (TradFi), new financial products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have emerged, offering exposure to crypto tokens. Products such as BlackRock's IBIT (spot Bitcoin ETF) and Bitwise's BITW (multi-token ETF) provide investors access to digital assets through familiar brokerage platforms. This surge in new financial products has sparked interest in deploying effective trading strategies that capitalize on pricing mechanisms.

Strategy investigates statistical arbitrage opportunities in multi-token cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) through pairs trading with synthetic portfolios. Using historical price data for multi-token ETFs like Bitwise's BITW, we implemented a trading strategy that pairs these ETFs with synthetic portfolios and identifies arbitrage opportunities based on pricing discrepancies.
